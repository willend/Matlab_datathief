# Matlab_datathief
Small Matlab GUI-tool allowing to pick a series of plot datapoints from an imported image.

Usage:
1) Load a (png or other bitmap) version of a graph, e.g. 
https://github.com/willend/Matlab_datathief/raw/master/test.jpg

2) Define your axis to be linear, lin-log, log-lin or log-log

3) Click two welldefined, diagonal points spanning the graph

4) Input min-max ranges of x and y coordinate

5) Click 'Get data' to start collecting points. Once you have collected what you want, right-click within the graph

6) Save your x-y coordinate set, here is an example:
